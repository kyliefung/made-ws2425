## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Comparative Analysis of Firearm Ownership and Crime Rates in the United States and Germany

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does the prevalence of high and low firearm ownership correlate with crime rates in the United States and Germany, and what differences can be observed between the two countries?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Firearm ownership is always a controversial issue in North America, especially in the United States. However, the ongoing debate on gun control policies does not change the right for citizens to own firearms due to constitutional reasons. This project aims to analyze the correlation between firearm ownership levels and various crime rates, including violent crimes and homicides, in the United States and Germany. 

By analysing data on gun ownership and crime statistics from both countries, this project is designed to identify patterns and assess whether higher rates of firearm ownership are associated with higher or lower crime rates. Therefore, the comparative analysis can provide insights into how cultural, legal, and societal differences influence the relationship between gun ownership and crime.
